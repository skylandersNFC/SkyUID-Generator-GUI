# SkyUID Generator GUI Version 1.0
----------------------------------------

This is a python GUI app that can create Skylander dumps, adjusted for a specific UID.

It's helpful if you have NFC UID locked cards (Sector 0, Block 0 Read-Only) and you need to prepare each dump before flashing it, so it's aligned with the UID of your card.

If you have a proper Python .py file extension association, you can run it by double clicking on the "main.py" file and using the GUI.

If not, run it via "python main.py" command inside CMD from the same directory where the script is.

You only need to provide your NFC card UID in order to generate a dump for it.
The skylanders listed in the dropdown are from the "Skylanders Ultimate NFC Pack" (V5), so pretty much the best dumps out there you can find.
